# Orbitary_Simulator
AI-Powered Orbital Mechanics Simulator 🌌
This is an interactive, physics-based sandbox application where you can create, observe, and manipulate your own solar systems. Using the power of the Gemini API, you can generate unique cosmic scenarios from simple text prompts, or build your own system from scratch.
✨ Features
🤖 AI System Generator: Describe a solar system (e.g., "a calm system with two suns," "a chaotic asteroid field"), and the Gemini API will generate a unique orbital system, including planets, suns, and a matching background color.

🪐 Realistic Physics Engine:

Gravitational Attraction: All bodies exert gravitational forces on each other based on their mass.

Elastic Collisions: Planets collide and merge, conserving mass and momentum for a realistic effect.

🎨 Interactive Sandbox:

Launch Planets: Click and drag anywhere to launch new planets with a specific velocity.

Mouse Interaction: Gently push planets with your cursor, or hold Shift to attract them.

🎛️ Full Control Panel:

Gravity Control: Adjust the universal gravitational constant in real-time.

Orbital Trails: Control the length of the beautiful, glowing trails left by planets.

Simulation Controls: Pause, play, and reset the simulation at any time.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: For the core structure of the application.

CSS3: For modern styling of the UI and control panel.

JavaScript (ES6+): For the entire simulation logic, physics engine, user interaction, and class-based object creation.

Gemini API: Used for the generative AI feature, interpreting user prompts to create JSON-based solar systems.
